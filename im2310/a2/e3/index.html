  PROVIDE MEANINGFUL FEEDBACK TO THE FOLLOWING ELEMENTS:
  1) <button> with the id of load-link on the loading page (index.html)
  2) <div> with the id of load-throbber on the loading page (index.html)
  3) <li> inside of the <ol> inside of the <nav> on the information page (hosono.html)
  4) <button> with the id of mode-button on the information page (hosono.html)
  5) switchModes() function - hint you can add a transition CSS property to the <body> and it will be inherited 
     by all the elements inside, so when custom CSS variables are changed it will apply transition

  1. This button is given several css styling to improve user interactivity. A pointer cursor is applied to show that
  the text can be interacted with. Likewise, the text colour changes and a soft highlight of the button shape appears to
  further encourage engagement with the button through the hover function. A solid blue is used for clear contrast and
  visibility. When the button is clicked, the active css is applied, making the text red and changing the background colour.
  This also indicates to the user that the button function is working and their interaction has registered. 
  
  2. The implementation of a load-throbber should provide users with an indication that their website loading is progressing.
  Here, the loading bar that appears off-center left and slowly progresses. The loading bar reaches to the other side of the 
  page, and through the starting starting pointm uses symmetry to give the user the ability to gauge its progression. Once it
  is complete, the load-throbber looks symmetrical on both sides of the page along the Y-axis and turns green. This animation 
  is done using the cyclecolour animation set to 10s, the time it takes for the page to load. The text "Loading . . ." is also
  implemented to further indicate to the user that the load-throbber is a loading bar. An ellipsis animation is used on the 
  ". . ." for even more suggestion that the website is currently loading. A transition of colour from grey to green is applied 
  between two keyframes at the end (94% - 100%). Brighht green is commonly identified with correct or complete, and its use here 
  is a clear indication that the loading has worked correctly and is finished. A grey text is chosen to be visible over the white 
  background and the dark grey loading bar, as the bar passes it. Finally, the text changes to "Loading Complete" for even 
  clearer indication to the user. It also transitions to black to be clearly visibile over the bright green background.
  
  3. Each of these links are give a class from one to six. Through this they are given a transition on hover. A similar interaction
  is seen throughout this website, this being transition to blue text and darker background with cursor change to pointer on mouse 
  hover. This same styling is applied to the load-link button and dark mode button. By establishing these similarities, the user can
  immediately interpret that each of these elements on the webpage can be interacted with using a click. The links here are also 
  given an underline to suggest a slightly different function from the buttons. Just like the load-link, activating each <li> turns the 
  text red and changes background colour to communicate the website is responding to the users action. The <li> and mode-button also
  both have a slightly grey background colour of the same shade to increase visual harmony as elements to be interacted with on the 
  hosono page. It also allows both to be seen in dark mode. A black font is added to prevent a change to white on mode-button click.
  The white colour would otherwise be too hard to see against its light grey background.
  
  4. As mentioned above, this mode-button aims to uses the coherence of having the same visual cues and interactions as the other 
  styled buttons/links. The same transitions to text and background colour occur, providing clear feedback to the user's actions upon
  hovering, clicking and click-holding. This button text is also set to black to prevent it from being difficult to see when turning 
  white against its background. 

  5. A simple transition is added to the <body> using "transition: background-color 0.5s ease." Transition states how the CSS changes
  over time when a hover or active interaction occurs. This transition is then applied to the "background-color" property and is set 
  for a duration of 0.5s. Ease times the function to slowly speed up then slow down again for a smooth transition effect. The change in
  colour of the body and shift to white text is a clear indication of immediate feedback upon clicking the mode-button.

        Typically I'd use an <a> here but as we're faking a load time I'm using a <button> instead.  If it was an 
        <a> I would leave off the target attribute so that it would redirect the current tab.

        This is a div we're using for the throbber - if we wanted to do a % based loading bar there is an element 
        called <progress> but as this one is just indicating a wait rather than providing direct feedback on progress I've 
        opted for using a <div>.
