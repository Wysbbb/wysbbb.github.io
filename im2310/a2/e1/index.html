            Here I created a container and classes for all of the manga panels I would be making. The composition of this website used the 
            Katsushiro Otomo-Akira Vol1-page 167 wireframe. Each panel would reference the panels from the manga.
          -->
       

<div class="background"></div>

          <!--
            A seperate class was created for the background, foreground and text so that each could be edited to move at different speeds. It also 
            allowed for layering in-front of or behind the panels. The png's that I used for each of these were all digitally drawn by me.
